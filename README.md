URGENT
- Change create batter and edit batter to include first name and last name fields

Shorter term (like before our first live matchups at practice)
- Make load times more even with API/Ajax
- For staff/pitcher pages, create a filter to include/not include matchups
- Simplify team stats especially for matchups only stats
- Add more useful, advanced stats to both pitcher/staff pages
- Go through all tables and make them as readable as possible (truncate, percentages, etc.)
- Add "conference" column to opponent table
- When showing tables, make it so that it only shows stats for pitches you throw or threw that outing. Have others hidden to stats
- Add hard hit variable coding to pitch locations and sprays chart
- Create system where you can add spray chart locations retroactively. 
- Add an edit at_bat page to the batter pages where you can edit the at bat pitches without having to go to pitcher outing


Longer term (like before first game?)
- Create filter to look at over a certain time frame? 
- Add a lot of scouting features (sprays, notes, etc.)
- Add "position" column to batter?
- Create opponent pitcher roster table
- Add support for pitch location in new outing csv
- Add pitch location randomization for basic pitch locations in upload outing and edit pitches
- Add hit location randomization for field spray charts from fielder location (1-9 on gb, ld, fb)


- Global Improvement Goals:
  - API
    - Generate code for api that can return certain stat calculations based on user controlled input
    - Attach API calculations to tables in site
    - Attach user buttons to AJAX requests
