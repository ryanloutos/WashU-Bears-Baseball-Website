The project structure and login pages were learned and/or taken from 
https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world
The blog walks through setting up a flask app for someone with no experience and was used 
to get the ball rolling

To do
- Go through code and make sure everything is neat and organized where it is at
- Get debugger working for vscode
- Make the function documentation things
- 

Ideas for improvement
- Make num_pitches automatic
- Make count_balls and count_strikes automatic
- Improve little data entry things
- Figure out way to make data entry fast and easy
- Make default seasons to choose from
- Create a filter so you can choose to see cumulative data for team and/or individual pitchers over a certain time, season, etc.
- Make a neat, clean, easy to read summary page for any outing(s)

Currently being worked on:
- Creating a csv entry point for pitch information
  - read pitches into outing form
  - more file validation points
  - make sure temp files deleted at end
  - make sure when saving that temp file names are not duplicated
  - safety checks for file existence
