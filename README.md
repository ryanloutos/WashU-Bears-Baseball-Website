Shorter term (like before our first live matchups at practice)
- Make load times more even with API/Ajax
- For staff/pitcher pages, create a filter to include/not include matchups
- Simplify team stats especially for matchups only stats
- Add more useful, advanced stats to both pitcher/staff pages
- Add ability to add photos to pitchers (similar to opponents)
- Organize season pages by games instead of outings
- Go through all tables and make them as readable as possible (truncate, percentages, etc.)
- Move outing stats to homepage of outing....make it more like a "report"
- Add "conference" column to opponent table


Longer term (like before first game?)
- Create filter to look at over a certain time frame? 
- Add a lot of scouting features (sprays, notes, etc.)
- Add "position" column to batter?
- Create opponent pitcher roster table


- Global Improvement Goals:
  - API
    - Generate code for api that can return certain stat calculations based on user controlled input
    - Attach API calculations to tables in site
    - Attach user buttons to AJAX requests
