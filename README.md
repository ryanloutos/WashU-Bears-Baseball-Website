By Sat 2/22 For Hendrix:
- Add all of Hendrix batters and pitchers to Opponent/Pitcher/Batter tables
- Make sure pitch tracking is ready to track opponents
- Edit any necessary pages for basic opponents analysis while still keeping our own
- Adjust opponent pages to include pitching information too
- Adjust batter stats page AB's to have AB's and PA's
- mod opponent page to include opponent pitchers and hitters

Other Goals/Ideas For Improvement
- (Ryan) Finish adjusting staff pages and finalize them for now
- (Ryan) Keep going across the site to make the navigation and info simple and easy to digest
- For staff/pitcher pages, create a filter to include/not include matchups
- Create filter to look at over a certain time frame on different parts of the site
- Create system where you can add spray chart locations retroactively. 
- Create system to adjust pitch locations retroactively
- Add an edit at_bat page to the batter pages where you can edit the at bat pitches without having to go to pitcher outing
- Add result column to batter at_bats page
- Put in pitch/spray locations for older outings:
  - Add support for pitch location in new outing csv?
  - Add pitch location randomization for basic pitch locations in upload outing and edit pitches
  - Add hit location randomization for field spray charts from fielder location (1-9 on gb, ld, fb)
